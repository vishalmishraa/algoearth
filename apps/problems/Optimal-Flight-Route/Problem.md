## Optimal Flight Route

Given a list of flights, departure and arrival city IDs, maximum number of stops allowed, layover costs, maximum layover time, time windows for flying out of cities, city connections, and a budget, find the optimal flight route from the departure city to the arrival city that minimizes the total cost while adhering to the constraints of maximum stops, layover times, and budget.

### Inputs:

- `flights`: A list of tuples, where each tuple represents a flight with fields: source city ID, destination city ID, and cost.
- `departureCityID`: The ID of the departure city.
- `arrivalCityID`: The ID of the arrival city.
- `maxStops`: The maximum number of stops allowed on the route.
- `layoverCosts`: A list of costs associated with each city for layover.
- `maxLayoverTime`: The maximum time allowed for layover in any city.
- `timeWindows`: A list of tuples, each representing a time window for flying out of a city: city ID, max departure time.
- `cityConnections`: A dictionary with city IDs as keys and lists of directly connected city IDs as values.
- `budget`: The total budget for the trip.

### Outputs:

- `route`: A list of city IDs representing the optimal route.
- `totalCost`: The total cost of the optimal route.
- `totalTime`: The total time taken for the trip, including layovers.
- `totalStops`: The total number of stops made on the route.
- `withinBudget`: A boolean indicating if the total cost is within the budget.
- `layovers`: A list of tuples, each representing a layover with fields: city ID, layover time.

### Example:

#### Input:

- `flights`: `[(1, 2, 100), (2, 3, 200), (1, 3, 500)]`
- `departureCityID`: `1`
- `arrivalCityID`: `3`
- `maxStops`: `1`
- `layoverCosts`: `[0, 50, 50]`
- `maxLayoverTime`: `2`
- `timeWindows`: `[(1, 10), (2, 5)]`
- `cityConnections`: `{1: [2], 2: [3], 3: []}`
- `budget`: `400`

#### Output:

- `route`: `[1, 2, 3]`
- `totalCost`: `350`
- `totalTime`: `3`
- `totalStops`: `1`
- `withinBudget`: `True`
- `layovers`: `[(2, 1)]`

This example demonstrates finding an optimal route from city 1 to city 3 with constraints on stops, layover time, and budget. The solution identifies the route that minimizes the total cost while meeting all the specified requirements.
