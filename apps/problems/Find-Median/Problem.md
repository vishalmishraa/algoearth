## Find Median

Given an array of integers, find the median of the array.

For example,

Input:
```
[5, 2, 9, 1, 7]
```

Output:
```
5
```

Input:
```
[10, 4, 8, 3, 6]
```

Output:
```
6
```

Note: The median is the middle element of a sorted array. If the array has an odd number of elements, the median is the middle element. If the array has an even number of elements, the median is the average of the two middle elements.
